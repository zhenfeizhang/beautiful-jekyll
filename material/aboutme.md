title: About me
---

I am a cryptographer.
Prior to that, I worked for [Ant Group](https://www.ant-group.com), [Algorand](algorand.com),
and [OnBoard Security Inc](https://www.onboardsecurity.com/).
I received my Ph.D. from
[University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) in 2014.

I worked on cryptography for blockchains and contributed to [several cryptographic libraries](https://zhenfeizhang.github.io/material/projects/).  I am also involved in __2__ out of 7 [NIST PQC finalists](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions): [NTRU](https://ntru.org)
and [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/).
My main research area has been lattice-based
cryptography, NTRU cryptosystems, fully homomorphic
encryptions, and zero knowledge proof systems.

My [Erdos number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_by_Erd≈ës_number) is __3__.


You may find a [CV](../cv/output/cv.pdf) and
[highlights of projects](https://zhenfeizhang.github.io/material/projects/) that I worked on;
last update Oct 2020.

I have [openings](https://www.iacr.org/jobs/item/2440) for cryptographic engineers.
