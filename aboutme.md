This is the personal website of me.

In the day I am a cryptographer. I work on lattice based cryptography. I had the pleasure to work with my collaborators on almost all aspects related to lattice based cryptography, with a special focus on NTRU cryptosystem. You may find a (out-of-date) CV [here](pdf/cv.pdf).


In the night I am a laker fan.
