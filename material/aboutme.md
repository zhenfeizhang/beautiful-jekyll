title: About me
---

I am a Cryptographic Engineer at [Algorand](algorand.com).
Here I deal with cryptography for blockchains and write several cryptographic libraries.
Before jointing Algorand, I was the director of cryptographic
research at [OnBoard Security Inc](https://www.onboardsecurity.com/);
and a
Research Scientist for [Security Innovation Inc](https://www.securityinnovation.com/).  I contributed to __2__ out of 7 NIST PQC finalists: [NTRU](https://ntru.org)
and [Falcon](https://falcon-sign.info/).

I received my Ph.D. from
[University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/) in 2014.
My main research area has been lattice-based
cryptography, NTRU cryptosystems, fully homomorphic
encryptions, and anonymous signatures.
I am also actively working on standardization
of quantum-safe cryptography for various standards bodies.


You may find a [CV](../cv/output/cv.pdf) and
[highlights of projects](https://zhenfeizhang.github.io/material/projects/) that I worked on;
last update April 2020.
